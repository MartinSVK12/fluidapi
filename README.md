# Fluid API for Better Than Adventure

# This mod has been superseded by [Catalyst](https://github.com/MartinSVK12/catalyst)! This repository is archived and will not update.

Improved fluid storage and transport for Babric/BTA.

Blocks added by this mod should serve as templates for other mod developers and can be disabled completely in the config.

*Mod works in singleplayer only for now, i have no idea how minecraft networking works.*
